# TwitterCollector
(v.4 - April 7, 2016)

This repo contains [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and Python scripts for collecting and analyzing data from [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).

## What's in the repo

- [```/files```](files/) - contains files used and produced by the scripts
- [```/scripts```](scripts/) - the Python action
- [```environment.yml```](environment.yml) - file for creating an Anaconda environment with all the dependencies you need
- [```requirements.txt```](requirements.txt) - file for installing dependencies via ```pip```
- [```settings-example.cfg```](/config/settings-example.cfg) - an example settings file that you can copy to ```settings.cfg``` to make the scripts and notebook work
- [```twitter.ipynb```](twitter.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook that explains the collection and analysis processes and runs the scripts (the meat of the repo, really)
