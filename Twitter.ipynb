    "## Setup\n",
    "Before you start, you need a few things:\n",
    "1. Twitter OAuth credentials\n",
    "2. plain-text file containing either Twitter handles or user ids (one per line)\n",
    "3. ```settings.cfg``` with proper settings\n",
    "4. virtual environment with all the necessary Python modules - we provide [`environment.yml`](environment.yml) for `conda` users and [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for `pip` users (NOTE: we've tested these only on OS X)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Twitter OAuth Credentials\n",
    "Here's [Twitter's overview](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview) of the credentials and the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### List of users to fetch\n",
    "The scripts can look for either handles or user ids but not both. So, you need to create a plain-text file with one handle or user id per line. We provided [```list_example.txt```](list_example.txt) to show you how.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Settings\n",
    "1. Copy [```settings-example.cfg```](config/settings.cfg) to ```settings.cfg```\n",
    "2. Replace the values in ```settings.cfg``` with settings appropriate for your environment and with your own Twitter credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The settings (besides Twitter credentials) are\n",
    "- logfile: the name of the file where you want to log the script's output (mostly progress updates)\n",
    "- listfile: the name of the file containg your list of handles or ids to fetch\n",
    "- outfolder: path to the folder where you want the script to store the JSON(s) returned by Twitter\n",
    "- user_id: set to `true` if you provided a list of ids, otherwise leave it as `false`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collect and Cache\n",
    "To download the user timelines as JSON files (one per use), run the script below:"

For instance, [Ilan Manor](http://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/people/arDetails?qeh_id=MAN6IM4365) likes to work in Excel, so we created a parser for him that puts the data he cares about into a CSV Excel can read."
